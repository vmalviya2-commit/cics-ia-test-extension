## Getting Started
<a name="_toc159989885"></a>To Configure Zowe CICS IA Explorer follow the steps below.

## Loading CICS IA profiles from CICS profiles
- By Default, CICS profiles from CICS VS Code extension is loaded into CICS IA View.
- Below is the Configuration screen for creating a new CICS profile.

    ![](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.006.png)

- After Creating a new CICS Profile refresh CICS IA view, we should be able to see the newly created CICS profile getting loaded automatically under CICS IA view as well.

    ![](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.007.png)

- The CICS IA tree view should show all the CICS profiles created in CICS Extension

    ![](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.008.png)

*NOTE: If the CICS connection is failing with red indicator icon then that CICS profile should fail in the CICS IA view also.

![](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.009.png)

## Create New CICS IA Profile 

![](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.010.png)

- Click on the ‘+’ icon next to existing CICS IA profile and in editor window a panel opens. Provide the Hostname, Port, and Protocol of server where IA Rest APIs are running. 
- Click on the Update Profile button. 

    ![](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.011.png)

- Once the IA profile is created, CICS IA view will start loading the data from the DB Schema (Schema details are configured on Rest API WebSphere server running on mainframe) and creates the tree hierarchy inside the CICS IA Profile.
## Update CICS IA Profile 
  ![](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.012.png)

- Click on the yellow highlighted icon and in right side editor window a panel opens with existing profile details. Update the details that you want to alter.

    ![](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.013.png)

- Once the IA profile is updated, again CICS IA view will start loading the data from the DB Schema (Schema details are configured on Rest API WebSphere server running on mainframe) and refreshes the tree hierarchy inside the updated CICS IA Profile.
## CICS IA Profile
CICS IA profile upon successful connection displays Green indicator icon over the profile name. If connection not successful, then displays Red indicator icon over the profile name. CICS IA profile on Successful connection extracts the Collected Dependency and Affinity data from the DB2 Schema to which REST API is configured. When CICS IA profile node is expanded, below child items are listed.

Below the header, a toolbar is displayed with tools for 

`      `![ref6]  Expand all the resources in the view.

![ref7] Collapse all resources in the view.

You can recall the results of previous searches, and move between searches, by using the Previous search ![ref8] and Next search ![ref9]  icons in the toolbar of the view.  
## Uses view
From transaction or program or web service node, you can explore resources further to see which resources the transaction or program or webservice is using and in which regions. 

To show the regions in which the program or transaction or webservice resource is being used, right-click the resource, then click Uses Resources. You can specify whether to analyze use for a specific region, or for all regions.

The information about the selected resource and region populates the Uses view in the Editor window.

Select **Uses Resources > Specific Region** to display the resources used in that region.

![](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.043.png)

The Uses view has three sections:

- The Left Pane displays the list of resources used by selected Program/Transaction/Webservice organized into folders by **Resource Type**. If you expand a resource Type folder by clicking ![ref10], you can view the resources using the specific resource type. If we expand resource further by clicking ![ref10],, you can view the verb nodes that were executed against the resource.
  - In the above example on expanding Program Resource Type folder, we get to see 2 Programs TESTPGM and TESTPGM2. On expanding TESTPGM2 resource, we could see that the program TESTPGM2 resource was executed using 2 commands LINK and LOAD.
- The Middle Pane displays Program/Transaction in which the selected resource is invoked.
- The right Pane displays tree hierarchy for the resource usage grouped by Regions.

## Affinities view
The Affinities view displays an alphabetical list of resources with potential affinities related to the target object.

CICS® transactions and programs use some techniques to exchange data that require those transactions or programs to run in the same CICS region, or in a specific CICS region. The result of such requirements is restrictions on the regions to which transactions and distributed program link (DPL) requests can be dynamically routed. If transactions or programs exchange data in ways that impose such restrictions, these are known as affinities between them.

The affinity-related functions of CICS IA have the following uses:

- Users of CICS dynamic routing can determine whether any transactions in their CICS applications have an inter-transaction affinity (some transactions must run in the same region) or a transaction-system affinity (some transactions must run in a specific region).
- Application programmers can detect whether a program being developed might cause transaction affinities.

![](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.045.png)

Right-click the item that you want to view the affinities for and click **Show Affinities By Type**. The **Show Affinities By Type** menu is linked to the type of object that is currently selected, rather than the view the object is in. You can also right-click an item in the Programs or Transactions node to display the affinities menu items.

The Affinities view includes 2 sections. 

- The upper section displays either,
  - Affinity Group or 
  - Resource, the affinity relation type, Lifetime of affinity or
  - Affinity relation type, Lifetime of affinity
- Upon selection of an item in the upper section, the lower section displays the Transaction, Program and Command resulting in the selected affinity type.
## Threadsafe Report view
Use the Threadsafe Report view to view summary or detailed reports of threadsafe issues in HTML format.

For information about creating threadsafe reports, see [Creating a report of threadsafe issues](#creating-a-report-of-threadsafe-issues).

The Threadsafe Report view includes the following sections:

- Program summary section.
- Program details section.
## Program Summary
The upper section of the Threadsafe Report view displays the program summary information. The programs are grouped by the collection IDs and regions. You can expand the tree structure to display the programs and statistics for threadsafe, non threadsafe, indeterminate threadsafe, threadsafe inhibitor, and other calls issued by each program. To show program details, click the program name.

In the **Reentrant** column, Y indicates that the program is reentrant, a blank indicates that the program is not reentrant, and ? indicates that the reentrant status is not known.

## Command Flow view 
The Command Flow view shows the execution details of a selected task. It shows the Task Control Block (TCB) modes that were used, any TCB mode switches, and a command flow table.")
The Command Flow view shows the execution details of a selected task. It shows the Task Control Block (TCB) modes that were used, any TCB mode switches, and a command flow table.

The Command Flow view has three sections: TCB Modes Used, TCB Mode Switches, and the command flow table.
## TCB Modes Used
The TCB Modes Used section displays a summary of the TCB modes that were used during the execution of the task, including the total number of commands issued in each TCB mode.

To see the individual commands and resources, expand the tree structure.

If you select a command in this section, the command is highlighted in the command flow table.
## TCB Mode Switches
The TCB Mode Switches section displays a summary of any TCB mode switches that occurred during the execution of the task. Commands and resources are grouped by the mode that they switched from, then the mode that they switched to.

To see the mode that is switched to, and individual commands and resources, expand the tree structure.

If you select a command in this section, the command is highlighted in the command flow table.
## Command flow table
The command flow table displays the command flows, ordered by time, under the program that ran the command. By default, the current and previous TCB Mode, and the time when the command ran, are shown for each command.

Events associated with EXEC CICS commands are displayed as child nodes of the command in the view. These child nodes are the events that are triggered against a command.

The icon for a resource can have the following icons attached:

- ![asterisk icon](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.048.png)Event processing icon. You can create an event binding, to use with event processing, from this resource. This option is available only for resources and API calls that match valid event processing resources. 
- ![conflict icon](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.049.png)TCB mode switch icon. The command caused a TCB mode switch to occur.
- ![warning icon](./docs/images/CICSIA.Words.2521e191-aa0c-43da-8799-3d24aab9b5d3.050.png)Warning icon. The command has a nonzero RESP or RESP2 code.
